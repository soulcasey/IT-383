In Hyper Area, the player is a soldier in hyper area to be selected as a Elite Virtual Warriors

In every minigame, each player will be sent to their designated location with a small area to zone to be able to move physically. There is no additional navigation system such as teleportation or walk, as the player is only allow to stay in the zone. The movement of the headset will still be applied, so if the player attempts to escape the zone by physically moving, it will show a warning then automatically teleport the user back to the center of the circle

The player spawns in a training area on a floating square platform where all the minigames will take place. The player can move around by physically walking, but no additional navigation methods such as teleportation or controller movement will be provideds since movement is not required for the minigames and all activities will be confined to the platform. If the player walks off the edge, they will fall and be teleported back to the center of the platform.

At the start of a minigame, a selected gun will spawn in front of the player. The player must grab the gun correctly to activate it, allowing them to shoot at a target that appears on the platform across from where they are standing.

In Hyper Area, the player is a soldier in hyper area to be selected as a Elite Virtual Warriors

In every minigame, each player will be sent to their designated location with a small area to zone to be able to move physically. There is no additional navigation system such as teleportation or walk, as the player is only allow to stay in the zone. The movement of the headset will still be applied, so if the player attempts to escape the zone by physically moving, it will show a warning then automatically teleport the user back to the center of the circle

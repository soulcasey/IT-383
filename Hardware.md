In this game, there will be no need for any axis or top button presses. The UI Navigation will be done through gunshot, where the user will aim at the displayed UI and aim at the button they wish to press. The only buttons that the players will need to press are the grab button in order to hold the guns and the trigger button to shoot the grabbed gun.

The controls remain the same to maintain simplicity, as the only buttons the player needs to press are the grab button to hold the gun in place and the trigger button to shoot. All UI navigation will be handled by shooting at the menu screen displayed on the right.
